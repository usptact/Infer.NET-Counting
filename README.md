# Infer.NET-Counting
Machine Learning Summer School 2009 workshop example

An urn contains fixed but unknown number of 2 color balls (say, black and white). The proportions of colors is known: half of the balls are white, another half is black. A random ball is picked from the urn, get its color recorded and replaced back in the urn. A number of draws is performed and the observed colors are recorded. The task is to infer the (discrete) distribution over ball numbers.

Example: Ten draws were made from the urn. It happened that all colors are black. Would it be likely to have two balls in the urn? 5? 10? 100?

Finally, what happens if the observations are noisy?
